# Game Time Starter Kit (FE - Module 2)

Basic Game Time starter kit.

## Goals

Use OOP to drive the design of the game and the code
Separate business-logic code from view-related code
Create a robust test suite that thoroughly tests all functionality of a client-side application

### V.01
When receiving this project and messing with the dimensions of our canvas, I was immediately reminded of an old-school game like Bubble Bobble. Playing field in the middle, some kind of wallpaper behind it with Player UI elements along the sides.

### V.02
After removing the canvas wallpaper and deciding to not mess with drawing unnecessary elements on the canvas, I picked a low-res Escape From New York image as a wallpaper. It gained a lot of approval from fellow classmates, but I wasn't keen on having a giant handgun on the middle our page. I considered photoshopping it out when I realized there was an image of the twin towers in the same photo. I figured that this was going to be too much work for how little the payoff would be, and moved onto something else

###  V1.0 
I finally found a high-res enough scan of the poster from the movie Escape From New York. I had to lower the color settings a bit.
