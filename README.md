# Game Time Starter Kit (FE - Module 2)

Basic Game Time starter kit.

## Goals

Use OOP to drive the design of the game and the code
Separate business-logic code from view-related code
Create a robust test suite that thoroughly tests all functionality of a client-side application

### V.01
When receiving this project and messing with the dimensions of our canvas, I was immediately reminded of an old-school game like Bubble Bobble. Playing field in the middle, some kind of wallpaper behind it with Player UI elements along the sides.

### V.02
After removing the canvas wallpaper and deciding to not mess with drawing unnecessary elements on the canvas, I picked a low-res Escape From New York image as a wallpaper. It gained a lot of approval from fellow classmates, but I wasn't keen on having a giant handgun on the middle our page. I considered photoshopping it out when I realized there was an image of the twin towers in the same photo. I figured that this was going to be too much work for how little the payoff would be, and moved onto something else

###  V1.0 
I finally found a high-res enough scan of the poster from the movie Escape From New York. I had to lower the color settings a bit.

I decided to add an extra page to our game, which added some initial complexity. How are we going to stop the arrow keys from scrolling through the page? I assume most others with this project didn't have this issue, because their site was only one 100VH. We quickly came up with a solution to have the control keys be WASD instead. This actually made playing the game a lot easier and more intuitive, as Macbook Pro's have smaller UP and DOWN arrow keys, making it easier to accidentally hit one or the other.

Lastly, we needed a way for our users to learn more about us. I added a small contact menu bar with shiny buttons at the bottom. I'd like to add some more magic to this section at some point, but I didn't want to detract from the game more than I already did.
